" # ENCS5340--NLP--Arabic-Auto-complete-Question-Answering-System-for-the-Holy-Quran." 
# 📌 Project Overview
This project introduces a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system designed to enhance interaction with Quranic Arabic. It provides auto-completion for Arabic text and a question-answering system that extracts relevant answers from the Quran.

🔹 **Auto-Completion Module** - Predicts words/phrases in Quranic Arabic.

🔹 **Question Answering System** - Finds exact answers from the Quran.

🔹 **Advanced NLP Techniques** - Uses N-gram models, weighted Jaccard coefficient, & Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

🔹 **Contextual Understanding** - Ensures answers align with Quranic meanings.

# 🚀 Key Features
✅ Predicts Next Words in Quranic Arabic.

✅ Retrieves Exact Answers from the Quran.

✅ Handles Various User Queries Efficiently.

✅ Optimized for Accuracy & Speed.

# 🧠 Models & Methodology
This project leverages cutting-edge NLP techniques to provide Arabic auto-completion and question-answering for the Holy Quran.

1️⃣ **N-gram Model (*for Auto-completion*)**
  - Predicts the next word/phrase based on previously typed words.
  - Uses probabilistic word sequencing to refine predictions.


2️⃣ **Weighted Jaccard Coefficient (*for Text Matching*)**
  - Prioritizes important words while reducing stop-word impact.
  - Helps refine the auto-completion system for accuracy.

    
3️⃣ **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) (*for Question Answering*)**
  - Understands Quranic Arabic syntax & semantics.
  - Matches user queries with relevant Quranic passages.

    
4️⃣ **TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity (*for Retrieval*)**
  - Extracts most relevant answers from Quranic text.
  - Ranks answers based on query similarity.

# 🔥 How It Works
1️⃣ User starts typing a question or phrase in Arabic.

2️⃣ Auto-complete suggests the next words.

3️⃣ User submits a question, and the system retrieves the most relevant answer.

4️⃣ Context-aware NLP models ensure accuracy.
